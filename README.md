# Matching-Game
This game is built on the html, css and Javascript principles. When this game is opened in the browser, you can see two sides.
On the left hand side, there are 5 smiley emoji and on the right hand side, there are only 4 of them. The rule of this game is
very simple. You have to locate and find the extra emoji present on the right hand side of the browser. If you click on the extra 
emoji on the left hand side, 5 more emoji will be added on the left and 4 more on the left. So it keeps adding emoji until you 
click on the extra emoji on the left hand side but when you click the wrong emoji, the game is terminated.
